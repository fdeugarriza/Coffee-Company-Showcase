# Coffee-Company-Showcase
This project is intended to be more of a showcase of the different functions that a data analyst could employ on a day-to-day basis for a company. 
We create an imaginary Coffee Company with a database that consists of four tables: "employees" "locations", "shops" and "suppliers".

We begin by inserting values into all our tables and we then move onto the "analysis" (which, as I've said, is more of a showcase of different functions in PostgreSQL).

At the end, I try to play with a 30-day moving total, but I'm not sure I did a great job of it, lol.
